Work Session (25 minutes) – Focus on a single task without distractions.
Short Break (5 minutes) – Take a quick rest to refresh your mind.
Repeat – After four work sessions, take a longer break (15–30 minutes).
This cycle enhances concentration, reduces mental fatigue, and boosts efficiency. Many Pomodoro timers come with customizable time settings, task tracking, and notifications.
